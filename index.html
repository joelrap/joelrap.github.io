    <p>Today in Fortnite, Midas activated the dooms day device to destroy team shadow. Midas is the leader of team ghost and he is planning on flooding the map to win the war of team shadow and ghost. Personally I like team shadow the most, because the characters look better and I like the name shadow. In Midas’s room there is a suit that looks like the tempest skin. Tempest is known to control the storm.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I went for a walk with my dad, it took us over an hour to walk 5 miles. After that I got some v-bucks and I spent it on two skins: Vix and Commando. I played with my new skins with my friends online. After that I watched Modern Family with my tea, and then The Nut Job in bed.
This morning I went for a bike ride and then a walk with my brother and Dad.</p>

    <p>Today I went for a walk with my family. Then I did some English. My topic is a long story about the King of Fishes who grants wishes. Next I did some maths which was about hundredths as decimals. I also went on Times Tables Rockstars. After lunch I did a spelling test. I also played outside with my brother Josh. I played CodeMonkey in the afternoon and completed seven levels on it.</p>
