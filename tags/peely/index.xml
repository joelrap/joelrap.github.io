      <description>Today I went a bike ride. After that I did my mMaths and English. I had to do a spelling test and got 100%. Later on I am going to have my lunch. Then I have a break before I am learning some french. Then I will play with my friends on Fortnite. I also got a new game called Tom Hero.</description>

      <description>Today in Fortnite, Midas activated the dooms day device to destroy team shadow. Midas is the leader of team ghost and he is planning on flooding the map to win the war of team shadow and ghost. Personally I like team shadow the most, because the characters look better and I like the name shadow. In Midasâ€™s room there is a suit that looks like the tempest skin. Tempest is known to control the storm.</description>
