      <description>King Midas was one of the richest kings. All he wanted was gold. He turned to gold. Dionysus, God of Wine, gave Midas his gold touch.
Midas had kids.
The tomb of Midas looks like a big hill. There is an electric fence around it. It is in Greece. There is a lake around it too.</description>
